    "According to the last 6 weeks' data over **49.7%** of sales were brought in by the **Email** method followed by **Calls** method with **33%** and then by **Email And Call** method with **17.1%** . This allows us to conclude that Email method was the most effective one to bring in sales.\n",

    "While looking at the revenue generated by these approaches we notice that even though Call method brought in more customers, it generated least revenue of around 23000, while Call and Email method generating a disproportionately high revenue of around 47000 and surpassing Call method revenue. As expected Email method generated the most revenue amounting to around 72000.\n",

It can be seen that the data for Email approach is evidently right skewed with a number of outliers on the higher revenue side, the mean revenue is around 97. For the Call method, mean revenue is quite low around 47. The revenue for Call and Email combined method lies around high revenue with range around 120 ~ 240, with a mean of around 183.\n",

This specific analysis also makes a case against the Email only approach which starts as higher than Calls only appraoch but the rate by which products are being sold start to decline as compared to Call only and Call and Email combined appraoch. This means in the long run our Emails and Call combined approach will do better than both of other approaches.\n",

Emails only approach starts off well but fails to show substanstial growth by the end of 6th week.\n",

As our data suggested previously, the cumulative revenue for Calls and Emails combined method starts low and grows quite fast all throughout the duration of test. As the time progresses the rate of increase of cumulative revenue is increasing which shows promising trend if we persue this method.\n",
